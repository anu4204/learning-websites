<em> Doechii | 2024</em>
<hr/>

<p>Hey, I thought it was all over (yeah)</p>
<p>    What's up, Doechii? (Hey, girl) </p>
<p>    You know it's been a lil' minute since you and I </p>
<p>    Have had a chat (has it really?) </p>
<p>    Probably since like, your last EP, "Oh The Places You'll Go" </p>
<p>    (Oh, wow) yeah (it's been a minute, yeah) </p>
<p>    I've been gettin' some calls (oh?) </p>
<p>    People are a little bit worried about you (not worried, okay) </p>
<p>    And I know that I was kinda that outlet for you, so (you were) </p>
<p>    Why don't you just tell me what's been goin' on? (Okay) </p>

<p>    Remember old dude from 2019 </p>
<p>    Nice clean nigga did me dirtier than laundry (than laundry) </p>
<p>    Took a scroll through his IG </p>
<p>    Just to get a DM from his wifey (what the fuck?) </p>
<p>    I was so confused, what should Doechii do? </p>
<p>    She didn't know about me and I didn't know 'bout Sue </p>
<p>    I open up the messages, then had to hit the zoom </p>
<p>    Turns out the girl was really a dude (goddamn) </p>
<br>

<p>    Nigga think he slicked back 'til I slipped back </p>
<p>    Got my lick back, turned a nigga to a knick-knack (to a knick-knack) </p>
<p>    I moved on, dropped a couple of songs </p>
<p>    And then I went and got signed, now it's 2021 </p>
<br>

<p>    Okay, I just feel like this is the perfect opportunity for us to just </p>
<p>    Take a second and kind of unpack what's happened to you </p>
<p>    You know, this guy cheated on you and - </p>
<p>    Mm, nah (oh), fuck it </p>
<br>

<p>    Platinum record this, viral record that </p>
<p>    I'm makin' so much money, I'm all over the net </p>
<p>    I'm movin' so fast, no time to process </p>
<p>    And, no, I'm not in a gang, but I'm always on set (yeah) </p>
<p>    Wristwatch, drip drop, labels want the TikToks </p>
<p>    Now I'm makin' TikTok music, what the fuck? </p>
<p>    I need a cleanse, need a detox </p>
<p>    But we ain't got time to stop, the charts need us (and they do) </p>
<br>

<p>    Fast forward me 2023 </p>
<p>    I'm stackin' lots of cheese and makin' money </p>
<p>    My grass is really green, and honestly </p>
<p>    I can't even fucking cap no more, this is a really dark time for me </p>
<p>    I'm goin' through a lot </p>
<p>    (By a lot, you mean drugs?) Um, I wouldn't - </p>
<p>    (Drugs?) No, it's a -, (no?) It's a natural plant </p>
<p>    (No, I'm not judging) I'm not an addict </p>
<p>    (I'm just sayin') I don't think - </p>
<p>    (You wanna talk about it?) Uh </p>

<p>    I mean fuck, I like pills, I like drugs </p>
<p>    I like gettin' money, I like strippers, I like to fuck </p>
<p>    I like day-drinkin' and day parties and Hollywood </p>
<p>    I like doin' Hollywood shit, snort it, probably would (yeah) </p>
<p>    What can I say? The shit works, it feels good </p>
<p>    And my self-worth's at an all time low </p>
<p>    And just when it couldn't get worse </p>
<p>    My ex crashed my place and destroyed all I owned (yeah) </p>
<br>

<p>    Whoopsie, made a oopsie </p>
<p>    100, 000-dollar oops made me loopy (yeah) </p>
<p>    I ain't a killer, but don't push me </p>
<p>    Don't wanna have to turn a nigga guts into soup beans </p>
<br>

<p>    Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (rurr), okay, Doechii </p>
<p>    We don't wanna revert back into our old ways (sorry, okay) </p>
<p>    So we're gonna try a breathin' exercise, okay? (Alright, word) </p>
<p>    When I breathe (okay), you breathe </p>
<p>    Alright? Let's go (what?) </p>
